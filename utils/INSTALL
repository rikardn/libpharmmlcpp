Installation of pharmmlutils

*** Linux and Mac ***

To build and install on Linux and Mac the g++ C++ compiler must be available together
with the development files for libxml2 and libxslt. g++ must be of a fairly new version
6.3.0 has been tested to work but a bit earlier versions might also work. 

tar zxvf pharmmlutils-0.4.tar.gz
cd pharmmlutils-0.4
./configure
make
make install
