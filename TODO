* Add --version

* Should not assume that for example one and only one ParameterModel exists.
* blkId as namespace to symbIds
* gather Symbols/Objects to be done via call to model and recursion
* Remove Objects from PharmML visitor. Now kept duplicated


* IndividualParameter to have method to create assignment of structured form (and back would be good of course!)
